I am a doctoral candidate in Mathematics at Nanjing Normal University. My research interests focus on the application of algebraic geometry  to complex network game problems, and the application of polynomial optimization to operations research in the economic field.

My Personal Experiences
------
I was born in Pan'an County, Jinhua City, Zhejiang Province, China in 1997. In 2015, I enrolled in Zhejiang University of Science and Technology to study economics. Initially, I was interested in economic theories, especially the content of the game theory course. However, I soon realized that my true passion lay in the field of pure mathematics. So after graduating from my undergraduate program, I gained admission to the mathematics program at Jiangsu University by self-studying mathematics courses. Under the guidance of my supervisor, my main research focus was on carbon emission forecasting and assessment. Between 2022 and 2025, while conducting this core research, I developed a strong interest in algebraic geometry. In 2025, I obtained my Master's degree in Mathematics, and in the same year, I joined Nanjing Normal University as a PhD candidate in Mathematics. Currently, I am working to apply algebraic geometry in fields such as game theory, complex networks, and energy economics.

The Topics I Am Interested In
--------
* The number of complex solutions of polynomials has been well estimated by the Bernstein-Khovanskii-Kushnirenko (BKK) Theorem. Then, for more complex network structures, the number of quasi-Nash equilibria in network-based games can also be estimated to a certain extent using the BKK Theorem. What is the relationship between the number of quasi-Nash equilibria and the network structure? Can we go one step further to directly estimate the number of Nash equilibria?
* What is the relationship between the number, geometric configuration, and parameters of Nash equilibrium solutions? How to describe the bifurcation process of the solutions?
